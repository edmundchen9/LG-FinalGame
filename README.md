Edmund Chen - Final Project Game: Mind Maze

This game is created with Unity and C# for scripts. All assets are not mine and instead downloaded from the free assets store. 

HOW TO PLAY
In the assets folder, navigate to the scenes folder and click on the start game scene to begin. For buttons on the UI, you will need to use your mouse cursor and click to progress.
Controls are shown on the start screen, but is as follows:
A - left
D - Right
Shift - Sprint
Space - Jump

Based on some student testing, it is recommended to sprint and jump together in the first level to reach the platform easier.

Hope you enjoy!
